# Snake-and-Ladder-Game
Ladders and Snakes are defined with dictionaries mapping a starting position to an ending position.
Player Positions (pos1 and pos2) are initialized at 0, and each player's movement is managed using the move function.
Players take turns throwing the dice by pressing the corresponding key ("A" for Player 1 and "B" for Player 2).
If a player lands on a snake, they move to the tail of the snake; if they land on a ladder, they climb it to the top.
